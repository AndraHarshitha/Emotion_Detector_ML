# Emotion_Detector_ML
An emotion detector uses machine learning (ML) models to classify emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, or disgust. The system is trained on labeled datasets where emotions are already known, allowing it to learn patterns and make predictions on new, unseen data.
